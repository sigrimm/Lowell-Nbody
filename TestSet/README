From Nick:

The test_set*txt files are x,y,z,xdot,ydot,zdot for the first 100 non-perturber (what we consider massless) asteroids.
These are heliocentric, ecliptic coordinates retrieved from astorb.

The JPL vectors script shows how to retrieve barycentric (location=‘@0’), ecliptic coordinates of minor planet Ceres
across a range of dates at 1 day time steps. Heliocentric coordinates can be retrieved by changing location=‘@sun’.
The creation of the Horizons object in this script can also be performed for just a single epoch as indicated in the commented line.


Test objects: 
main belt, no non-grav effects
	Varuna
	Chiron
	Nestor
	Astraea
	Kalliope
	105140
